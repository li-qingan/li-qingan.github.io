<p>System Innovation for Mobile &amp; IoT Applications</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h3>

<p>Mobile computing has led to paradigm shifts in user behavior, application semantics, and device features. However, hasty software solutions that borrow legacy designs directly from conventional operating systems developed originally for desktops are not suitable for mobile systems intended for smartphones, tablets, wearables, or IoT devices, particularly in conjunction with cloud computing. We have been conducting scientific and engineering research to seek to affect the future designs of mobile and IoT systems. In this talk, I will give our research landscape and present several original design concepts for cloud-based energy saving services, user-centric mobile systems, and multi-device IoT applications. I will also demonstrate our prototype implementations on CHT hicloud, Android smartphones, and TI embedded devices to validate the practicality of the designs.</p>

<p>KVSSD: Close Integration of LSM Trees and Flash Translation Layer for Write-Efficient KV Store</p>

<h3 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h3>

<p>Log-Structured-Merge (LSM) trees are a writeoptimized data structure for lightweight, high-performance KeyValue (KV) store. Solid State Disks (SSDs) provide acceleration of KV operations on LSM trees. However, this hierarchical design involves multiple software layers, including the LSM tree, host file system, and Flash Translation Layer (FTL), causing cascading write amplifications. We propose KVSSD, a close integration of LSM trees and the FTL, to manage write amplifications from different layers. KVSSD exploits the FTL mapping mechanism to implement copy-free compaction of LSM trees, and it enables direct data allocation in flash memory for efficient garbage collection. In our experiments, compared to the hierarchical design, our KVSSD reduced the write amplification by 88% and improved the throughput by 347%</p>

<p>Energy Efficient Neural Network Accelerators for IoT Applications</p>

<h3 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h3>

<p>In this talk, two energy efficient neural network accelerators will be presented for low power IoT applications. The first accelerator proposes a kernel-optimized CNN architecture and an online training FC architecture. A 3x3 kernel-optimized architecture is implemented as a proof-of-concept, and the energy efficiency of which is 4.01x better than the state-of-the-art CNN processor. Furthermore, the proposed online training architecture further reduces parameters update operations by five orders of magnitude for IoT applications. Silicon implementation shows that the energy efficient can be up to 3.77Tops/W. The second accelerator aims at the energy harvesting wearable IoT devices. The accelerator employs RRAM-based nonvolatile logics (NVL) with self-write-termination scheme and low-power processing-in-memory (PIM) to achieve energy-efficient computing against frequent power-off situations. A test chip was fabricated in 150nm CMOS process using HfO RRAM. It achieves 462GOPs/J energy efficiency at 20MHz clock frequency.</p>

<p>File Fragmentation in Mobile Devices: Measurement, Evaluation, and Treatment</p>

<h3 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h3>

<p>Mobile devices, such as smartphones, have become a necessity in our daily life. However, users may notice that after being used for a long time, mobile devices begin to exhibit sluggish response. Based on an empirical study on a collection of aged smartphones, this work identified that file fragmentation is among the key factors that contribute to the progressive degradation of response time. This study takes a three-step approach: First, this study designed a set of reproducible file-system aging processes based on User-Interface (UI) script replay. Through the aging processes, it confirmed that file fragmentation quickly emerged, and SQLite files were among the most severely fragmented files. Second, based on the workloads of a selection of popular mobile applications, this study observed that file fragmentation did impact on user-perceived latencies. Specifically, the launching time of Chrome on an aged file system was 79% slower than it was on a pristine file system. Third, this study evaluated existing treatments of file fragmentation, including space preallocation, and file defragmentation to understand their efficacies and limitations. This study also evaluated a state-of-the-art defragmenter to show its advantage over the existing methods.</p>

<p>A Peripheral Circuit Reuse Structure Integrated with a Retimed Data Flow for Low Power RRAM Crossbar-based CNN</p>

<h3 id="abstract-5">Abstract</h3>

<p>Convolutional computations implemented in RRAM crossbar-based Computing System (RCS) demonstrate the outstanding advantages of high performance and low power. However, current designs are energy-unbalanced among the three parts of RRAM crossbar computation, peripheral circuits and memory accesses, and the latter two factors can significantly limit the potential gains of RCS. Addressing the problem of high power overhead of peripheral circuits in RCS, this paper proposes a Peripheral Circuit Unit (PeriCU)-Reuse scheme to meet power budgets in energy constrained embedded systems. The underlying idea is to put the expensive ADCs/DACs onto spotlight and arrange multiple convolution layers to be sequentially served by the same PeriCU. In the solution, the first step is to determine the number of PeriCUs which are organized by cycle frames. Inside a cycle frame, the layers are computed in parallel inter-PeriCUs while sequentially intra-PeriCU. Furthermore, a layer retiming technique is exploited to further improve the energy of RCS by assigning two adjacent layers within the same PeriCU so as to bypass the energy consuming memory accesses. The experiments of five convolutional applications validate that the PeriCU-Reuse scheme integrated with the retiming technique can efficiently meet variable power budgets, and further reduce energy consumption efficiently.</p>

<p>Applying Multiple Level Cell to Non-volatile FPGAs</p>

<h3 id="abstract-6">Abstract</h3>

<p>Static random access memory (SRAM) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are currently facing challenges of limited capacity and high leakage power. To solve this problem, non-volatile memory (NVM) is proposed as the alternative to build non-volatile FPGAs (NVFPGAs). Even though the feasibility of NVFPGA has been confirmed, the utilization of multiple level cells (MLC) has not been fully exploited yet. In this talk, I will introduce our exploration on applying MLC to NVFPGAs. Specifically, we study architecture of MLC based NVFPGAs, and propose five cluster structures, as well as the corresponding working mode supported by MLC based clusters.</p>
