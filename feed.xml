### Title

System Innovation for Mobile &amp; IoT Applications

### Abstract

Mobile computing has led to paradigm shifts in user behavior, application semantics, and device features. However, hasty software solutions that borrow legacy designs directly from conventional operating systems developed originally for desktops are not suitable for mobile systems intended for smartphones, tablets, wearables, or IoT devices, particularly in conjunction with cloud computing. We have been conducting scientific and engineering research to seek to affect the future designs of mobile and IoT systems. In this talk, I will give our research landscape and present several original design concepts for cloud-based energy saving services, user-centric mobile systems, and multi-device IoT applications. I will also demonstrate our prototype implementations on CHT hicloud, Android smartphones, and TI embedded devices to validate the practicality of the designs.

### Title

KVSSD: Close Integration of LSM Trees and Flash Translation Layer for Write-Efficient KV Store

### Abstract

Log-Structured-Merge (LSM) trees are a writeoptimized data structure for lightweight, high-performance KeyValue (KV) store. Solid State Disks (SSDs) provide acceleration of KV operations on LSM trees. However, this hierarchical design involves multiple software layers, including the LSM tree, host file system, and Flash Translation Layer (FTL), causing cascading write amplifications. We propose KVSSD, a close integration of LSM trees and the FTL, to manage write amplifications from different layers. KVSSD exploits the FTL mapping mechanism to implement copy-free compaction of LSM trees, and it enables direct data allocation in flash memory for efficient garbage collection. In our experiments, compared to the hierarchical design, our KVSSD reduced the write amplification by 88% and improved the throughput by 347%

### Title

Energy Efficient Neural Network Accelerators for IoT Applications

### Abstract

In this talk, two energy efficient neural network accelerators will be presented for low power IoT applications. The first accelerator proposes a kernel-optimized CNN architecture and an online training FC architecture. A 3x3 kernel-optimized architecture is implemented as a proof-of-concept, and the energy efficiency of which is 4.01x better than the state-of-the-art CNN processor. Furthermore, the proposed online training architecture further reduces parameters update operations by five orders of magnitude for IoT applications. Silicon implementation shows that the energy efficient can be up to 3.77Tops/W. The second accelerator aims at the energy harvesting wearable IoT devices. The accelerator employs RRAM-based nonvolatile logics (NVL) with self-write-termination scheme and low-power processing-in-memory (PIM) to achieve energy-efficient computing against frequent power-off situations. A test chip was fabricated in 150nm CMOS process using HfO RRAM. It achieves 462GOPs/J energy efficiency at 20MHz clock frequency.

### Title

File Fragmentation in Mobile Devices: Measurement, Evaluation, and Treatment

### Abstract

Mobile devices, such as smartphones, have become a necessity in our daily life. However, users may notice that after being used for a long time, mobile devices begin to exhibit sluggish response. Based on an empirical study on a collection of aged smartphones, this work identified that file fragmentation is among the key factors that contribute to the progressive degradation of response time. This study takes a three-step approach: First, this study designed a set of reproducible file-system aging processes based on User-Interface (UI) script replay. Through the aging processes, it confirmed that file fragmentation quickly emerged, and SQLite files were among the most severely fragmented files. Second, based on the workloads of a selection of popular mobile applications, this study observed that file fragmentation did impact on user-perceived latencies. Specifically, the launching time of Chrome on an aged file system was 79% slower than it was on a pristine file system. Third, this study evaluated existing treatments of file fragmentation, including space preallocation, and file defragmentation to understand their efficacies and limitations. This study also evaluated a state-of-the-art defragmenter to show its advantage over the existing methods.

### Title

A Peripheral Circuit Reuse Structure Integrated with a Retimed Data Flow for Low Power RRAM Crossbar-based CNN

### Abstract

Convolutional computations implemented in RRAM crossbar-based Computing System (RCS) demonstrate the outstanding advantages of high performance and low power. However, current designs are energy-unbalanced among the three parts of RRAM crossbar computation, peripheral circuits and memory accesses, and the latter two factors can significantly limit the potential gains of RCS. Addressing the problem of high power overhead of peripheral circuits in RCS, this paper proposes a Peripheral Circuit Unit (PeriCU)-Reuse scheme to meet power budgets in energy constrained embedded systems. The underlying idea is to put the expensive ADCs/DACs onto spotlight and arrange multiple convolution layers to be sequentially served by the same PeriCU. In the solution, the first step is to determine the number of PeriCUs which are organized by cycle frames. Inside a cycle frame, the layers are computed in parallel inter-PeriCUs while sequentially intra-PeriCU. Furthermore, a layer retiming technique is exploited to further improve the energy of RCS by assigning two adjacent layers within the same PeriCU so as to bypass the energy consuming memory accesses. The experiments of five convolutional applications validate that the PeriCU-Reuse scheme integrated with the retiming technique can efficiently meet variable power budgets, and further reduce energy consumption efficiently.

### Title

Applying Multiple Level Cell to Non-volatile FPGAs

### Abstract

Static random access memory (SRAM) based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are currently facing challenges of limited capacity and high leakage power. To solve this problem, non-volatile memory (NVM) is proposed as the alternative to build non-volatile FPGAs (NVFPGAs). Even though the feasibility of NVFPGA has been confirmed, the utilization of multiple level cells (MLC) has not been fully exploited yet. In this talk, I will introduce our exploration on applying MLC to NVFPGAs. Specifically, we study architecture of MLC based NVFPGAs, and propose five cluster structures, as well as the corresponding working mode supported by MLC based clusters.

### Title
Flash Memory Performance and Reliability Optimization: From Chips, Controllers to Systems

### Abstract

In this talk, I will present our recent works on Flash memory for performance and reliability optimization. This talk will include three parts. The first part will present the background and related works on Flash chip level design. As the quality and reliability of the data written is highly correlated with the Flash programming speed, how to exploit these characteristics are important for Flash memory based storage systems. In addition, state-of-the-art Flash memory is experiencing degraded reliability together with significant process variations. To cope with these issues, several works will be presented which optimize performance and reliability for Flash memories. The second part will present the work on Flash controller design, including parallelism exploration for performance and error correction codes optimizations for reliability. We are especially interested in Low Density Parity Codes, which have good error correction capability, but with high cost in terms of decoding performance. We will also discuss how to exploit the significant process variations for performance and lifetime improvement. The third part will discuss the work on system level of flash based storage devices. Current systems of flash storages have not yet fully exploited the characteristics of flash memory. In this part, I will presents the work on fragmentation issues on smartphone and discuss a cross layer supported I/O scheduling algorithm to achieve performance improvement.

### Title

Design Software and Systems for Non-volatile Processors on Self-Powered Devices

### Abstract

The vision of Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data with the operators and other connected devices, resulting in improved social/economic benefits and overall human well-being. It is estimated that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 2020. While the vision is promising and exciting, it is challenging to power these 50 billion embedded devices. Energy harvesting is one of the most promising techniques to power these embedded devices. However, harvested energy is intrinsically unstable. With an unstable power supply, the whole computer system will be interrupted frequently. In this talk, the speaker will present solutions and challenges in designing computer systems to survive frequent power interruption.

### Title

Improving LDPC Performance Via Asymmetric Sensing Level Placement on Flash Memory

### Abstract

Flash memory development through technology scaling and bit density has significant impact on the reliability of flash cells. Hence strong ECC schemes are highly recommended. With a strong error correction capability, LDPC is now applied for the state-of-the-art flash memory. However, LDPC needs fine- grained soft sensing between states to iteratively decode the raw data when the raw bit error rates are high, which requires long decoding latency and leads to performance degradation.

In this talk, I will introduce a novel sensing level placement scheme to reduce the LDPC decoding latency. The basic idea for the placement scheme is motivated by two asymmetric error characteristics of flash memory: the asymmetric errors at different states, and the asymmetric errors caused by voltage left-shifts and right-shifts. With understanding of these two types of error characteristics, the sensing levels are smartly placed to achieve reduced sensing levels while maintaining the error correction capability of LDPC. Experiment analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement.

### Title

Near-storage processing for data-intensive applications

### Abstract

Modern high-performance processors are constrained by the end of Dennard scaling in terms of energy dissipation. Traditional compute-centric model is not effective for modern big data applications with large working sets and limited locality. The system performance is now dominated by large data volume and the cost of moving data to the locations where computations are performed. These trends challenge the traditional computation model, leading to the transition to move computation units nearby data, the so-called Near-Data Processing. In this talk, I will present the recent trends in near data processing, focusing on the storage layer. In addition, I will talk about our in-progress works on this emerging area.

### Title

Heterogeneous architecture for convolutional neural network (CNN)

### Abstract

Architecting emerging NVMs, especially STT-RAM, PCM, ReRAM etc., as cache or main memory for MCUs is a promising technique to replace conventional SRAM/DRAM deployment. However, these emerging NVMs often suffer from long write latency and large write energy. Targeting stencil loops with data dependencies, we present several loop transformation techniques such as loop retiming, loop tiling and loop scheduling to reschedule loop traversals such that the drawbacks of NVMs can be greatly mitigated. In this way, high performance and low dynamic power can be achieved during loop execution.

Most recently, we focus on designing a heterogeneous architecture to implement convolutional neural network (CNN) for lightweight and power budget devices. The architecture consists of ReRAM crossbar and CPU+FPGA SoC where the PIM-featured ReRAM crossbar offers highly efficient MAC computing and the SoC part provides other uniform computing and controlling. The key issues such as CNN layer mapping, data communication between modules and application-level parallelism have been ongoing explorations.

### Title

Designing FPGAs using non-volatile memory technologies

### Abstract

Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has been widely adopted as modern reconfigurable computing platforms. Traditionally, the storage elements in FPGAs are conventional static RAM (SRAM), which has large leakage power and limited scalability. Recently, non-volatile memory (NVM) is proposed to replace the SRAM in FPGA systems for static power and density considerations, at the cost of inducing larger dynamic power. Although NVM-based FPGA architectures have been proposed, the design flow of FPGA systems is still SRAM-oriented. In this talk, I will present our recent work on NVM-based FPGA design, where NVM characteristics are integrated into the FPGA design flow, including read/write asymmetry and usage of multiple level cells.
